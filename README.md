My speaking Chinese language tutor bot. There are a lot of hardcoded items that could be cleaned up. Installation is pretty simple, and listed below. Note that LM studio has a chat interface built in, so if that's what you're looking for, you don't need this.

Install LM studio, download the model of your choice, enable the API under the Developer settings
Create a py venv
install the pre-requisites - flask, gtts, os, requests, json, uuid, re
Deploy this to your venv
run python3 ./main.py
